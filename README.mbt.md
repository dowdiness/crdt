# Canopy

**Write. It structures itself.**

<!-- TODO: Replace with a GIF showing: type code → tree updates → scope colors → evaluation result appears inline → second peer edits simultaneously -->

Canopy is an editor that understands your program, not just your characters. As you type, it parses incrementally, shows you scope and types, evaluates expressions live, and formats your code — all without leaving the flow. Two people can edit the same document simultaneously, with no server. Edits merge automatically.

## Why

Most editors treat source code as flat text. You type characters, and the tool does its best to guess what you meant — syntax highlighting, auto-complete, error squiggles — all reconstructed after the fact from dead text.

Canopy treats your program as a living structure. Text and syntax tree are **two synchronized views** of the same document. Type in one, the other updates. Restructure in one, the other follows. The editor doesn't guess what your code means — it knows, because it maintains the meaning incrementally as you type.

The goal: **close the gap between what you think and what the tool understands.** When the editor holds the same mental model you do — scope, types, values, dependencies — it can show you what matters, when it matters, without you having to search for it.

## What It Looks Like

The demo language is lambda calculus — small enough to understand fully, rich enough to exercise the full pipeline:

```
let double = λx. x + x
let result = double 5
if result then result else 0
```

As you type this, Canopy:
- Parses incrementally (one character change → one subtree reparse)
- Resolves scope (knows `x` is bound by `λ`, `double` refers to the definition above)
- Formats with syntax highlighting through the pretty-printer
- Evaluates `double 5 → 10` and `if result then result else 0 → 10`
- Synchronizes with any connected peer via CRDT

## How It Works

Four stages, each incremental:

```
Text CRDT → Incremental Parse → Projection → Rendering
    ↑                                            │
    └────── structural edits feed back ──────────┘
```

1. **Text CRDT** ([event-graph-walker](event-graph-walker/)) — The document lives in a FugueMax sequence CRDT. All edits — keystrokes, remote operations, undo/redo — enter here. Peers sync directly, no central server.

2. **Incremental parsing** ([loom](loom/)) — Only the affected region is reparsed. Unchanged subtrees are reused from the previous parse through position-independent CST nodes.

3. **Projection** — The syntax tree maps to a projection tree with stable node IDs and source spans. Node identity survives reparses, so UI state (selection, scroll) is preserved.

4. **Rendering** — The protocol layer computes incremental view patches. Only changed nodes reach the frontend. Multiple representations — formatted text, tree view, graph visualization — render from the same projection.

## The Bigger Picture

Canopy is a framework, not just an editor. Define a grammar for your language, implement a few traits, and you get incremental parsing, structural editing, pretty-printing, and CRDT collaboration out of the box.

But the long-term vision goes further. The code editor is a vertical slice of something larger: **a system where you write freely, structure emerges automatically, and the right information surfaces when you need it.** Every layer of the editor — incremental computation, semantic analysis, reactive projections, peer-to-peer sync — is a building block for that system.

## Framework Design

**Text is ground truth, structure is derived.** The text CRDT stores the document; everything else is computed. This means collaboration operates on a proven data structure, and the pipeline from text to view is a deterministic function of document state.

**Language support is data, not code.** Adding a new language means providing a grammar and a projection mapping. The framework handles parsing, reconciliation, undo/redo, and collaboration generically. Lambda calculus and JSON share the same core.

**Multiple representations from one source.** The [Printable trait family](docs/architecture/multi-representation-system.md) (Show, Debug, Source, Pretty) gives every language four text representations. `Source` guarantees `parse(to_source(x)) == x`. `Pretty` produces width-aware, syntax-annotated formatted output. Adding a new text format = adding a render function, not changing language code.

**Incremental by construction.** Every stage — parsing, projection, rendering — recomputes only what changed. This isn't bolted-on caching; it's the [architectural principle](docs/architecture/Incremental-Hylomorphism.md) the framework is built around.
