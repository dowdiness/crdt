# Claude Code Quick Reference

`AGENTS.md` is the canonical repo-level agent guidance file.
`CLAUDE.md` is a symlink to `AGENTS.md` for compatibility and should not be
edited directly. If the symlink is replaced by a regular file, restore
`CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md`.

Canopy — incremental projectional editor with CRDT collaboration, built in MoonBit.

## MoonBit Language Notes

- `pub` vs `pub(all)` visibility modifiers have different semantics — check current docs before using
- `._` syntax is deprecated, use `.0` for tuple access
- `try?` does not catch `abort` — use explicit error handling
- `?` operator is not always supported — use explicit match/error handling when it fails
- `ref` is a reserved keyword — do not use as variable/field names
- Blackbox tests cannot construct internal structs — use whitebox tests or expose constructors
- For cross-target builds, use per-file conditional compilation rather than `supported-targets` in moon.pkg.json
- Error handling syntax: use `Unit!Error` or `T!Error` for fallible return types. Error propagation uses `!` suffix on calls, not `raise` keyword. Always verify MoonBit syntax against recent compiler behavior before committing.

## MoonBit Code Search

Prefer `moon ide` over grep/glob for MoonBit-specific code search. These commands use the compiler's semantic understanding, not text matching.

```bash
moon ide peek-def SyncEditor              # Go-to-definition with context
moon ide peek-def -loc editor/foo.mbt:5   # Definition at cursor position
moon ide find-references SyncEditor       # All usages across codebase
moon ide outline editor/                  # Package structure overview
moon ide doc "String::*rev*"              # API discovery with wildcards
```

Symbol syntax: `Symbol`, `@pkg.Symbol`, `Type::method`, `@pkg.Type::method`

When to use: finding definitions, tracing usages, understanding package APIs, discovering methods. Falls back to grep only for non-MoonBit files or cross-language patterns.

**Documentation rules** (see [doctrine](docs/development/documentation-doctrine.md)):
- Architecture docs = principles only, never reference specific types/fields/lines
- Plans = implementation details, archived on completion
- Performance docs = dated snapshots, never updated (new measurements → new files)
- Code is the source of truth — if a doc and the code disagree, the doc is wrong

**Task tracking rules** (see [task-tracking](docs/development/task-tracking.md)):
- `docs/TODO.md` = active backlog index only, not the full implementation spec
- `docs/plans/*.md` = canonical execution spec for any non-trivial task
- GitHub issues = durable backlog/prioritization, not the only implementation plan
- For active work, keep exactly one canonical implementation spec and link everything else to it

**Submodule docs:**
- [event-graph-walker](event-graph-walker/README.md) - CRDT library
- [loom](loom/README.md) - Loom framework (lambda calculus parser in `loom/examples/lambda/`)

## Development Workflow

### UI / Visual Feature Rule

**CRITICAL:** Before writing a design spec or implementation plan for any UI or visual feature, build the **smallest working prototype** that touches the real system and test it manually in the browser. If you can't see the change working in 10 minutes, stop and re-evaluate.

1. **Prototype first (10 min):** Add one CSS class to one element, open the browser, verify it renders. Don't write plans.
2. **Spike unknowns (30 min):** Before building, answer platform questions with small experiments (DOM focus behavior, web component internals, framework re-render semantics). Don't assume — verify.
3. **Incremental manual testing:** After each integration point (not just `moon check`), open the browser and click. Especially for focus, keyboard events, and visual state.
4. **Don't batch-build UI features via subagents.** Tightly-coupled UI work (focus management, DOM events, visual feedback) needs human-in-the-loop feedback cycles, not parallel isolated implementation.
5. **Listen to user signals.** When the user questions the value of what you're building, stop and validate before continuing. User testing feedback > design spec > implementation plan.

### Performance Optimization Rule

**CRITICAL:** Before designing any performance optimization, write a microbenchmark that **reproduces the claimed bottleneck** in isolation. If the benchmark can't demonstrate the problem, stop and re-evaluate. Stale profiling data (from before prior optimizations) and O(bad) asymptotic complexity are not proof of a real problem. Check if existing mitigations (batch modes, caching, lazy eval) already neutralize the issue.

### Quality-First Approach

**CRITICAL:** When implementing or modifying MoonBit code, ALWAYS follow the `/moonbit-check` skill workflow to catch issues before they become bugs:

1. **Pre-flight**: Check dependencies with `moon update` before starting implementation
2. **Syntax awareness**: Verify MoonBit patterns (tuple destructuring, labelled args, error handling)
3. **Test verification**: Run tests and ensure error message formats match assertions exactly
4. **CLI testing**: If applicable, verify help text, flag behavior, and check for shadowing issues
5. **Interface review**: Update `.mbti` files and verify API changes are intentional
6. **Format & lint**: Run `moon fmt` and `moon check` before completing

### Incremental Edit Rule

**CRITICAL:** After every file edit, run `moon check` before proceeding to the next file. If there are errors, fix them immediately before continuing with the plan.

### Standard Workflow

1. Make edits
2. `moon check` - Lint
3. `moon test` - Run tests
4. `moon test --update` - Update snapshots (if behavior changed)
5. `moon info` - Update `.mbti` interfaces
6. Check `git diff *.mbti` - Verify API changes
7. `moon fmt` - Format
8. Rebuild JS if web affected

### Tracking Workflow

Before starting medium or large work:

1. Decide the canonical tracking surface using [docs/development/task-tracking.md](docs/development/task-tracking.md)
2. If the task is non-trivial, create a plan in `docs/plans/` from [docs/plans/TEMPLATE.md](docs/plans/TEMPLATE.md)
3. Add or update a short item in `docs/TODO.md` linking to that plan
4. Keep acceptance criteria and validation commands in the plan, not scattered across multiple docs

## MoonBit Conventions

- **Custom constructors for structs:** When defining public structs, declare a custom constructor via `fn new(...)` inside the struct body. This enables `StructName(args)` construction syntax with labelled/optional parameters, validation, and defaults. Prefer this over bare struct literals `{ field: value }`.
  ```moonbit
  struct MyStruct {
    x : Int
    y : Int

    fn new(x~ : Int, y? : Int) -> MyStruct  // declaration inside struct
  } derive(Debug)

  fn MyStruct::new(x~ : Int, y? : Int = x) -> MyStruct {  // implementation
    { x, y }
  }

  let s = MyStruct(x=1)  // usage — like enum constructors
  ```
- **Block-style:** Code organized in `///|` separated blocks
- **Testing:** Use `inspect` for snapshots, `@qc` for properties
- **Files:** `*_test.mbt` (blackbox), `*_wbtest.mbt` (whitebox), `*_benchmark.mbt`
- **Format:** Always `moon info && moon fmt` before committing
- **Trait impl:** `pub impl Trait for Type with method(self) { ... }` — one method per impl block
- **Arrow functions:** `() => expr`, `() => { stmts }`. Empty body: `() => ()` not `() => {}`
- **StringView/ArrayView patterns:** Use `.view()` + array patterns for iteration instead of index loops. Works with `String`, `Array`, `Bytes`. Prefer `loop s.view() { [ch, ..rest] => ...; [] => ... }` over `for i = 0; i < s.length(); i = i + 1 { s[i] }`.
  ```moonbit
  // Prefer this:
  loop text.view(), 0 {
    [], _ => ()
    [ch, ..rest], i => {
      process(ch)
      continue rest, i + 1
    }
  }
  // Over this:
  for i = 0; i < text.length(); i = i + 1 {
    let ch = text[i]
    process(ch)
  }
  ```
  Also useful for prefix matching: `match s.view() { [.."let", ..rest] => ... }` and palindrome-style middle access: `[a, ..rest, b] => ...`

## Code Changes

- Before suggesting code removal, check if symbols are re-exported as public API for downstream consumers. Do not delete structs/types that appear unused internally but may be part of the library's public interface.

## Code Review Standards

- Never dismiss a review request — always do a thorough line-by-line review even if changes seem minor
- Check for: integer overflow, zero/negative inputs, boundary validation, generation wrap-around
- Do not suggest deleting public API types (Id structs, etc.) as 'unused' — they may be needed by downstream consumers
- Verify method names match actual API before writing tests (e.g., check if it's `insert` vs `add_local_op`)

## Git & PR Workflow

- Always check if git is initialized before running git commands
- After rebase operations, verify files are in the correct directories
- When asked to 'commit remaining files', interpret generously even if phrasing is unclear
- When merging PRs, always verify CI status is actually passing (not skipped) before proceeding. Never represent CI as green if any checks were skipped or failed.
- After rebasing or refactoring, verify file paths haven't shifted unexpectedly. Run `git diff --stat` to confirm only intended files changed.

## Design Context

**Personality:** Elegant, Thoughtful, Deep — beauty emerging from structure.

**References:** Zed Editor, Dark/Luna, Strudel (strudel.cc)

**Anti-references:** Generic SaaS, toy/playground aesthetics.

**Design Principles:**
1. **Structure reveals meaning** — color, spacing, nesting communicate relationships before labels
2. **Progressive disclosure** — clean and focused by default, reveal depth on demand
3. **Typography carries weight** — Inter (UI) vs JetBrains Mono (code) creates clear zones
4. **Color is semantic, not decorative** — every color means something, no color without purpose
5. **Calm confidence** — solid and trustworthy, never frantic. Subtle transitions, generous whitespace

**Palette:** Deep navy base (`#1a1a2e`), purple accent (`#8250df`), syntax colors: keyword `#c792ea`, identifier `#82aaff`, number `#f78c6c`, string `#c3e88d`, operator `#ff5370`

See `.impeccable.md` for full design tokens and context.
