# Canopy — Agent Guidance

Incremental projectional editor with CRDT collaboration, built in MoonBit.

@~/.claude/moonbit-base.md

## Quick Commands

### Setup (after clone)
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/dowdiness/canopy.git
# or if already cloned:
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### Test & Build
```bash
moon test                           # canopy module tests
cd event-graph-walker && moon test # CRDT library tests
cd loom/loom && moon test          # Parser framework tests
cd loom/seam && moon test          # CST library tests
cd loom/examples/lambda && moon test # Lambda parser tests
moon info && moon fmt               # Format & update interfaces
moon check                          # Lint
```

### Web Development
```bash
cd examples/web && npm run dev      # Dev server (localhost:5173)
# Lambda editor: http://localhost:5173/
# JSON editor:   http://localhost:5173/json.html
moon build --target js              # Build for web
```

### Benchmarks
```bash
moon bench --release                # Always use --release
cd event-graph-walker && moon bench --release
cd loom/examples/lambda && moon bench --release
```

## Submodule Workflow

### Updating submodules
```bash
git submodule update --remote        # Pull latest from all submodules
git add event-graph-walker loom      # Stage submodule pointer updates
git commit -m "chore: update submodules"
```

### Making changes to a submodule
```bash
cd event-graph-walker
# make changes, commit, push
cd ..
git add event-graph-walker
git commit -m "chore: update event-graph-walker submodule"
```

## Adding a New Language

See [docs/development/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md](docs/development/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md) for the full guide (7 steps, with templates and validation checkpoints). Use Markdown as the reference implementation, not Lambda.

## Package Map

The SessionStart hook runs `scripts/package-overview.sh` which provides a live package map at the start of every session. Use `moon ide outline <path>` to explore any package's public API before modifying it. Read `moon.mod.json` for module dependencies.

## Documentation

Browse `docs/` for architecture, decisions, development guides, and performance snapshots. Key rules:

- Architecture docs = principles only, never reference specific types/fields/lines
- Code is the source of truth — if a doc and the code disagree, the doc is wrong
- `docs/TODO.md` = active backlog index; `docs/plans/*.md` = execution specs
- `docs/archive/` = completed work. Do not search here unless asked for historical context.

## Development Workflow

### UI / Visual Feature Rule

**CRITICAL:** Prototype first, plan later. Build the smallest working change, test it in the browser, then iterate. Don't batch-build UI via subagents — tightly-coupled UI needs human-in-the-loop feedback. When the user questions value, stop and validate before continuing.

### Performance Optimization (project-specific addendum)

The base rule (microbenchmark before optimizing) applies. Additionally: stale profiling data from before prior optimizations is not evidence. Check if existing mitigations (batch modes, caching, lazy eval) already neutralize the issue before proposing new ones.

### Quality & Edit Workflow

Hooks enforce `moon check` after every edit and `moon fmt && moon info` before commits. After edits, also run `moon test` and rebuild JS if web is affected. See [docs/development/task-tracking.md](docs/development/task-tracking.md) for tracking workflow.

## Architecture Conventions

- When adding shared content, use symlinks or references to a single source of truth. Never embed copies of shared files — flag the duplication problem first.

## Git & PR Workflow

- After rebase operations, verify files are in the correct directories
- When asked to 'commit remaining files', interpret generously even if phrasing is unclear
- **NEVER merge PRs until CI is fully green.** Run `gh pr checks <NUMBER>` and show the raw output — do not summarize or paraphrase. If any check is `pending`, `fail`, or `skipped`, STOP and report the exact status. Skipped is NOT passing. Do not claim CI is green without verifying.
- After rebasing or refactoring, verify file paths haven't shifted unexpectedly. Run `git diff --stat` to confirm only intended files changed.
- When making changes across submodules, always push submodule commits to remote BEFORE pushing the parent repo or creating parent PRs. CI will fail if submodule commits aren't available on remote.
- Always use PRs for submodule changes — never push directly to main branches of submodules without asking first.

## Design Context

**Personality:** Elegant, Thoughtful, Deep — beauty emerging from structure.

**References:** Zed Editor, Dark/Luna, Strudel (strudel.cc)

**Anti-references:** Generic SaaS, toy/playground aesthetics.

**Design Principles:**
1. **Structure reveals meaning** — color, spacing, nesting communicate relationships before labels
2. **Progressive disclosure** — clean and focused by default, reveal depth on demand
3. **Typography carries weight** — Inter (UI) vs JetBrains Mono (code) creates clear zones
4. **Color is semantic, not decorative** — every color means something, no color without purpose
5. **Calm confidence** — solid and trustworthy, never frantic. Subtle transitions, generous whitespace

**Palette:** Deep navy base (`#1a1a2e`), purple accent (`#8250df`), syntax colors: keyword `#c792ea`, identifier `#82aaff`, number `#f78c6c`, string `#c3e88d`, operator `#ff5370`

See `.impeccable.md` for full design tokens and context.
