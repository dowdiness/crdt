# CI/CD Documentation

Comprehensive guide to the continuous integration and deployment setup for the Lambda Calculus CRDT Editor.

## Overview

The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD with workflows for:

- **Automated Testing** - Run tests on every push/PR
- **Code Quality** - Enforce formatting and linting
- **Benchmark Tracking** - Detect performance regressions
- **Automated Deployment** - Deploy to GitHub Pages
- **Release Automation** - Create versioned releases

## Quick Start

### For Developers

```bash
# Run tests locally (like CI does)
make test-all

# Run all checks (formatting, linting)
make check-all

# Run full CI suite locally
make ci

# Install pre-commit hooks
make install-hooks
```

### For Maintainers

```bash
# Create a new release
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0

# Deploy to GitHub Pages (automatic on push to main)
git push origin main
```

## Workflows

### 1. CI Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

Runs on every push and pull request to ensure code quality.

#### Jobs

1. **test-main** - Tests the main CRDT module
   ```bash
   moon update
   moon check --deny-warn
   moon test --release
   moon build --release
   ```

2. **test-submodules** - Tests all submodules in parallel
   - event-graph-walker
   - parser
   - svg-dsl
   - graphviz

3. **format-check** - Ensures consistent formatting
   ```bash
   moon fmt
   git diff --exit-code  # Fails if changes detected
   ```

4. **build-js** - Builds JavaScript target
   ```bash
   moon build --target js --release
   ```
   Uploads `crdt.js` as artifact for downstream jobs.

5. **web-test** - Tests web frontend
   - Installs Node.js dependencies
   - Builds with Vite
   - Runs Playwright tests (if available)

6. **benchmark** (on PRs only) - Runs performance tests
   ```bash
   moon bench --release
   ```

#### Status Checks

All jobs must pass before merging. The `all-checks-passed` job provides a single status check.

### 2. Benchmark Regression

**File:** `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml`

Compares benchmark results between PR and base branch.

#### Process

1. Run benchmarks on PR branch
2. Checkout base branch
3. Run benchmarks on base branch
4. Compare results
5. Post comparison as PR comment
6. Upload raw results as artifacts

#### Reading Results

Look for:
- **Time differences** - >10% is significant
- **Consistency** - Verify with local runs
- **Patterns** - Multiple benchmarks degrading

Example comment:
```
## Benchmark Comparison Report

### Main Module Benchmarks

**Base branch:**
Benchmark: 1000_operations - 45.2ms
Benchmark: parse_complex - 12.8ms

**PR branch:**
Benchmark: 1000_operations - 42.1ms  ⬇️ 6.9% faster
Benchmark: parse_complex - 13.5ms   ⬆️ 5.5% slower
```

### 3. Deployment

**File:** `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Automatically deploys to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.

#### Build Process

1. **MoonBit Build**
   ```bash
   moon build --target js --release
   cp target/js/release/build/crdt.js web/public/
   ```

2. **Web Build**
   ```bash
   cd web
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Uploads `web/dist` to GitHub Pages
   - Publishes to `https://dowdiness.github.io/crdt/`

#### Setup Requirements

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "GitHub Actions"
3. Save

First deployment may take a few minutes. Subsequent deploys are faster.

### 4. Release Workflow

**File:** `.github/workflows/release.yml`

Creates GitHub releases with build artifacts.

#### Triggering Releases

**Via Git Tag:**
```bash
# Create and push a tag
git tag v0.2.0
git push origin v0.2.0
```

**Via GitHub UI:**
1. Go to **Actions** → **Release**
2. Click **Run workflow**
3. Enter version (e.g., `v0.2.0`)

#### Build Artifacts

The workflow creates:

1. **MoonBit Package** - `crdt-moonbit-{version}.tar.gz`
   - JavaScript builds
   - Module configuration
   - README and LICENSE

2. **Web Package** - `crdt-web-{version}.tar.gz`
   - Production web build
   - Ready to deploy

#### Changelog Generation

Automatically generates changelog from commits since last tag:

```
## What's Changed

- feat: add undo/redo support (a1b2c3d)
- fix: resolve sync conflict (d4e5f6g)
- chore: update dependencies (g7h8i9j)
```

## Dependency Management

### Dependabot

**File:** `.github/dependabot.yml`

Automatic dependency updates:

- **GitHub Actions** - Weekly updates
- **NPM packages** - Weekly updates (web, demo-react, valtio)
- **Grouped updates** - Playwright and Vite updates grouped

Dependabot creates PRs that are automatically tested by CI.

### MoonBit Dependencies

Update manually:
```bash
moon update                           # Update main module
cd event-graph-walker && moon update  # Update submodule
```

Add to CI if you need to test against latest dependencies.

## Local Development Scripts

### Makefile Targets

```bash
make help          # Show all available targets

# Testing
make test          # Test main module only
make test-all      # Test all modules + submodules

# Code Quality
make check         # Check main module
make check-all     # Check all modules
make fmt           # Format code

# Building
make build         # Build main module
make build-js      # Build JavaScript target
make build-web     # Build web application

# Development
make web-dev       # Build JS + start dev server
make clean         # Clean build artifacts
make ci            # Run full CI locally

# Setup
make install-hooks # Install git pre-commit hooks
make update        # Update all dependencies
```

### Scripts

Located in `scripts/`:

1. **build-web.sh** - Builds MoonBit JS + copies to web
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build-web.sh
   ```

2. **test-all.sh** - Tests all modules with nice output
   ```bash
   ./scripts/test-all.sh
   ```

3. **check-all.sh** - Runs check + format for all modules
   ```bash
   ./scripts/check-all.sh
   ```

4. **install-hooks.sh** - Installs pre-commit hooks
   ```bash
   ./scripts/install-hooks.sh
   ```

### Pre-commit Hooks

Install with `make install-hooks` or `./scripts/install-hooks.sh`.

The hook runs:
```bash
moon check --deny-warn  # Lint code
moon fmt                # Format code
```

Prevents committing code that would fail CI.

**Bypass (not recommended):**
```bash
git commit --no-verify
```

## Performance Optimization

### Build Times

**Parallel Testing:**
CI runs submodule tests in parallel using matrix strategy:

```yaml
strategy:
  matrix:
    submodule: [event-graph-walker, parser, svg-dsl, graphviz]
```

**Caching:**
Currently no caching (MoonBit builds are fast). Could add:
- Moon binary caching
- npm dependencies caching

### Artifact Storage

| Artifact | Size | Retention | Cost Impact |
|----------|------|-----------|-------------|
| JS builds | ~500KB | 7 days | Low |
| Benchmarks | ~10KB | 30 days | Very low |
| Releases | ~2MB | 90 days | Low |

Adjust retention periods in workflow files if needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Submodule Checkout Fails

**Symptom:** CI fails with "submodule not found"

**Solution:**
```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
  with:
    submodules: recursive  # ← Must be set
```

#### Format Check Fails

**Symptom:** CI fails on format-check job

**Solution:**
```bash
moon fmt
git add .
git commit -m "chore: format code"
```

#### Web Build Fails

**Symptom:** `crdt.js` not found in web build

**Solution:** Ensure JS build completes before web build:
```yaml
needs: build-js  # ← Web job depends on JS job
```

#### Benchmark Results Noisy

**Symptom:** Benchmarks vary wildly between runs

**Facts:**
- GitHub Actions runners have variable performance
- Benchmarks are for **relative** comparison, not absolute
- Look for consistent patterns, not single runs

**Mitigation:**
```bash
# Run locally for accurate numbers
make bench
```

### Debug Workflows

#### View Logs

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on failed workflow run
3. Click on failed job
4. Expand failed step

#### Run Workflow Manually

Most workflows support `workflow_dispatch`:

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Select workflow
3. Click **Run workflow**

#### Test Locally with act

Install [act](https://github.com/nektos/act):
```bash
brew install act  # macOS
# or
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
```

Run workflows locally:
```bash
act pull_request  # Run PR workflows
act push          # Run push workflows
```

Note: Some features (GitHub Pages, releases) won't work locally.

## Security

### Token Permissions

Workflows use minimal permissions:

```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read        # Read repository
  pull-requests: write  # Comment on PRs
  pages: write          # Deploy to Pages
```

No custom secrets required. Uses auto-generated `GITHUB_TOKEN`.

### Dependabot PRs

Dependabot PRs have restricted permissions and must pass CI before merging.

## Monitoring

### Status Badges

Add to README:

```markdown
![CI](https://github.com/dowdiness/crdt/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)
![Deploy](https://github.com/dowdiness/crdt/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)
```

### Notifications

Configure in **Settings** → **Notifications**:

- Email on workflow failure
- Slack/Discord webhooks (if desired)
