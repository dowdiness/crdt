# Module Structure

The codebase is organized as a **monorepo with git submodules**:

## Git Submodules (Standalone Libraries)

`.gitmodules` is authoritative for which submodules exist; this table adds the
GitHub repo and MoonBit-module mapping on top of that list.

| Submodule | GitHub Repo | MoonBit Module |
|---|---|---|
| `event-graph-walker/` | [dowdiness/event-graph-walker](https://github.com/dowdiness/event-graph-walker) | `dowdiness/event-graph-walker` |
| `loom/` | [dowdiness/loom](https://github.com/dowdiness/loom) | `dowdiness/loom`, `dowdiness/seam`, `dowdiness/incr`, `dowdiness/text_change`, `dowdiness/moji`, `dowdiness/pretty`, `dowdiness/lambda` (loom is itself a nested monorepo — see the `loom/` section below) |
| `svg-dsl/` | [dowdiness/svg-dsl](https://github.com/dowdiness/svg-dsl) | `dowdiness/svg-dsl` |
| `graphviz/` | [dowdiness/graphviz](https://github.com/dowdiness/graphviz) | `dowdiness/graphviz` |
| `rle/` | [dowdiness/rle](https://github.com/dowdiness/rle) | `dowdiness/rle` |
| `order-tree/` | [dowdiness/order-tree](https://github.com/dowdiness/order-tree) | `dowdiness/order-tree` (backs event-graph-walker) |
| `alga/` | [dowdiness/alga](https://github.com/dowdiness/alga) | `dowdiness/alga` (backs event-graph-walker) |
| `rabbita/` | [dowdiness/rabbita](https://github.com/dowdiness/rabbita) | vendored community UI library — not a root `moon.mod.json` dependency |

## `event-graph-walker/` Module (Core CRDT Library)

A reusable CRDT library implementing the eg-walker algorithm. Contains 5 packages:

### `causal_graph/`
Causal graph data structure for tracking operation dependencies.

- Maintains parent relationships and Lamport timestamps
- Implements transitive closure, graph diffing, and ancestry checks
- **Event graph walker** (`walker.mbt`) - Core eg-walker algorithm for topological traversal
- **Version vectors** (`version_vector.mbt`) - Compact representation of version frontiers for efficient network sync

### `oplog/`
Operation log for append-only storage of edit operations.

### `fugue/`
FugueMax tree implementation (ordered sequence CRDT).

### `branch/`
Branch/snapshot system for efficient document state reconstruction and merging.

### `document/`
CRDT document model (general-purpose text document).

**See:** [event-graph-walker/README.md](../../event-graph-walker/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## `loom/` module (lambda calculus parser + framework)

Monorepo containing the incremental parser framework and lambda calculus example.
The `crdt` module depends on `dowdiness/lambda` (`loom/examples/lambda/`) and `dowdiness/loom` (`loom/loom/`).

- `loom/loom/` — `dowdiness/loom`: generic parser framework (core, bridge, pipeline, incremental, viz)
- `loom/seam/` — `dowdiness/seam`: language-agnostic CST (`CstNode`, `SyntaxNode`)
- `loom/incr/` — `dowdiness/incr`: reactive signals (`Signal`, `Memo`)
- `loom/text-change/` — `dowdiness/text_change`: pure contiguous text-change utilities
- `loom/moji/` — `dowdiness/moji`: UAX #29 grapheme and word-boundary segmentation
- `loom/pretty/` — `dowdiness/pretty`: Wadler-Lindig pretty-printer
- `loom/examples/lambda/` — `dowdiness/lambda`: lambda calculus tokenizer, grammar, AST, benchmarks

This covers the loom packages most central to the editor; it is **not** exhaustive
— the root also consumes `dowdiness/json`, `dowdiness/markdown`, `dowdiness/egglog`,
and `dowdiness/egraph` from loom. `loom` is itself a nested monorepo:
`loom/.gitmodules` declares `incr`/`egraph`/`egglog`/`event-graph-walker` as
submodules and `loom/examples/` adds `json`/`markdown`. loom has no top-level
module file — each package owns its own `moon.mod.json`; `loom/.gitmodules` plus
the root `moon.mod.json` are authoritative for loom's package set and what the
root consumes.

**See:** [loom/README.md](../../loom/README.md) for detailed documentation.

## `crdt/` module (Canopy — projectional editor application)

Application layer that uses event-graph-walker and parser as path dependencies.

### `/` (root)
JavaScript FFI bindings that expose the editor API to JavaScript.

### `framework/core/`
Generic projectional editing primitives, independent of any language.

- NodeId, ProjNode[T], SourceMap, reconcile, assign_fresh_ids, get_node_in_tree
- ToJson for ProjNode and SourceMap
- Zero dependencies on `@ast` or `@lambda` — the load-bearing check for framework genericity
- Uses `TreeNode`/`Renderable` traits from `dowdiness/loom/core`

### `editor/`
High-level editor abstractions.

- `SyncEditor[T]` — generic facade composing `TextState`, `UndoManager`, `ImperativeParser`, and memo-derived projection views
- Lambda-specific wiring: projection memo builder, tree edit bridge, tree edit JSON

### `projection/`
Interactive tree editor state and projection UI logic.

- `TreeEditorState[T]` — interactive tree UI state, refresh/reuse algorithm
- `InteractiveTreeNode[T]` — decorated tree node for UI rendering

### `lang/*/proj/`
Projection builders — CST-to-ProjNode conversion, token span extraction, memo pipeline setup. One per language (lambda, json, markdown). Depends on core + parser.

### `lang/*/edits/`
Pure edit computation — edit op enums and span-edit calculators. No editor dependency; takes source text + ProjNode + SourceMap, returns SpanEdits. One per language.

### `lang/*/companion/`
Editor bridge — factory functions and edit application. Depends on editor + edits + proj. Delegates to `SyncEditor::apply_span_edits()` after computing edits. One per language.

### `lang/lambda/flat/`
Incremental FlatProj wrapper — memo-based incremental projection updates for lambda.

### `cmd/main/`
Command-line entry points and REPL.

### Trait placement

`TreeNode` and `Renderable` are defined in `dowdiness/loom/core` (the parser framework
defines how editors inspect ASTs). `dowdiness/lambda/ast` implements them for `Term`
(the type owner imports the traits). This resolves MoonBit's orphan rule cleanly:
neither side is "foreign" at the impl site.

## MoonBit Module Configuration

The root [`moon.mod.json`](../../moon.mod.json) is the **authoritative** list of
`dowdiness/*` dependencies — do not re-curate the full set here, or it re-drifts
(this section previously listed 5 of 15 deps and went stale).

Two declaration shapes appear there:

```json
{
  "deps": {
    // path dep — resolves to an in-repo submodule directory
    "dowdiness/loom": { "path": "./loom/loom" },
    // registry dep — pinned to a published mooncakes version
    "dowdiness/incr": "0.5.2"
  }
}
```

Most `dowdiness/*` deps are path deps into the submodules above; `incr` is the
notable exception, consumed as a registry version. For the complete, current
list, read `moon.mod.json` directly.

## Run Tests

```bash
moon test                                    # crdt module
cd loom/text-change && moon test             # Shared text-change leaf
cd loom/moji && moon test                    # Unicode segmentation leaf
cd event-graph-walker && moon test          # CRDT library
cd loom/loom && moon test                   # Parser framework
cd loom/examples/lambda && moon test        # Lambda example
```

## Design Rationale

### Why Submodules?

1. **Reusability**: Libraries can be used independently in other projects
2. **Separation of concerns**: Core CRDT logic is independent of lambda calculus
3. **Independent versioning**: Each library can be versioned and released separately
4. **Testing**: Each library tested independently
5. **Clarity**: Makes dependencies explicit
