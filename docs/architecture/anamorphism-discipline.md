# Anamorphism Discipline Guide

Actionable design principles for intermediate representations at pipeline boundaries.

Companion to [Incremental Hylomorphism](./Incremental-Hylomorphism.md) (theory). Referenced when designing new boundaries or auditing existing ones.

## 1. The Four Properties

These properties apply at boundaries where the intermediate structure will be incrementally reused or where partial results must be consumed by downstream stages. At one-shot or terminal boundaries (batch compiler, final display output), they are guidelines, not requirements.

> **Scope note.** These are engineering design principles motivated by the requirements of incremental reuse — not formal laws derived from coalgebra theory. See [Incremental Hylomorphism §2](./Incremental-Hylomorphism.md) for the theoretical context.

A good anamorphism output is a complete, context-free, transparent record of local construction decisions, including the decision that construction failed.

### Completeness

The intermediate structure preserves everything any downstream catamorphism could need.

**Test:** Can every downstream consumer be written using only this structure, without reaching back to the original input?

**Violation signal:** A consumer imports or accesses the input source directly instead of going through the intermediate structure.

### Context-Freedom

Each fragment's identity is independent of its position in the larger structure.

**Test:** Can a fragment of this structure be moved to a different position without changing any of its internal data?

**Violation signal:** Absolute positions, parent pointers, or global indices stored inside nodes.

### Uniform Error Representation

Malformed input produces the same kind of structure as well-formed input.

**Test:** Does the construction always produce the output type, with errors represented as values within the structure?

**Violation signal:** A separate error channel (exceptions, `Result` where `Err` means "no structure produced", `Option` where `None` means "parse failed") as the only path, with no recovery alternative that produces partial structure.

A strict/raising convenience wrapper alongside a structure-preserving recovery path is acceptable. The discipline requires that the recovery path exists, not that it is the only path.

### Transparent Structure

The representation's shape is its meaning. No hidden invariants, no internal state that consumers must understand to use the structure correctly.

**Test:** Can a new consumer be written by inspecting the structure's public fields alone, without knowing how it was constructed?

**Violation signal:** Invariants documented in comments rather than enforced by the type, or consumers needing to call methods in a specific order.

### Correspondence to the Asymmetry

Each property addresses one way anamorphisms are harder than catamorphisms (see [Incremental Hylomorphism §1](./Incremental-Hylomorphism.md)):

| Anamorphism difficulty | Property |
|---|---|
| Knowledge split between producer and consumer | Completeness |
| Local input changes cause global structural changes | Context-freedom |
| Structural failure (malformed input) | Uniform error representation |

Transparent structure is cross-cutting: it ensures any consumer can interpret the representation by inspecting its public form, without coupling to the producer's construction logic.

## 2. Boundary Audit

### Template

```
Boundary:     [name]
Producer:     [what constructs the structure]
Consumer:     [what folds/interprets the structure]

### Current State (2026-03-08, updated 2026-03-24)

> **Principles only.** This audit records which properties hold and which are violated at each boundary. For specific types, fields, and backing structures, see the source code directly.

**Boundary 1: CRDT Ops → Text Buffer**

```
Producer:     CRDT document (text sequence CRDT + operation log)
Consumer:     incremental lexer/parser
Intermediate: String (document text)

Completeness:     partial — text content complete, but damage information
                  (what changed) is lost. Consumer must rediscover
                  what changed via text diff.
Context-freedom:  partial — text is inherently positional. Not a problem
                  here because there is no incremental reuse of text
                  fragments.
Uniform errors:   pass — concurrent conflicts resolved deterministically
                  by the sequence CRDT. Never surfaced as errors.
Transparency:     pass — it is a string.

Gaps: No damage region output. The CRDT operation already knows what
      position was affected — surfacing that information would
      eliminate the retrospective diff.
```

**Boundary 2: Text → CST (loom)**

```
Producer:     incremental lexer + parser with reuse cursor
Consumer:     syntax views, term conversion, display
Intermediate: CST node (kind, children, relative width — see source for
              current field layout)

Completeness:     pass — every byte of source represented. Whitespace,
                  comments, error tokens all preserved.
Context-freedom:  pass — relative widths, no absolute positions. Subtrees
                  are pure values, reusable at O(1).
Uniform errors:   pass — error nodes are CST nodes with a different kind.
                  Same type. Recovery parser always produces structure.
Transparency:     pass — shape is meaning.

Gaps: none. Reference implementation of the four properties.
```

**Boundary 3: CST → Typed AST (aspirational)**

```
Producer:     semantic analyzer (not yet built)
Consumer:     renderer, completion engine, diagnostics
Intermediate: not yet designed

Completeness:     not designed — name resolution exists as a single-pass
                  fold, not an incremental structure.
Context-freedom:  not designed — no node identity scheme chosen.
                  Arena-based interning recommended for context-free identity.
Uniform errors:   partial — error variant exists for parse errors.
                  Semantic errors (unbound variables, type mismatches)
                  have no uniform representation yet.
Transparency:     not designed.

Gaps: This boundary needs design. This audit becomes the requirements spec:
      the typed AST must satisfy all four properties for incremental semantic
      analysis to work.
```

**Boundary 4: Typed AST → Display**

```
Producer:     projection layer (renderer, error list builder)
Consumer:     DOM (terminal — no further reuse)
Intermediate: String (rendered output)

Completeness:     partial — AST carries enough for current display.
                  No styling or layout metadata.
Context-freedom:  N/A — terminal output, no incremental reuse.
Uniform errors:   pass — error nodes render as entries in the error list
                  and highlighted nodes in the graph.
Transparency:     pass — strings.

Gaps: Full re-render on every change. No incremental rendering.
      Projection module exists but is not wired to the web frontend.
```

## 3. Anti-Patterns

### The Retrospective Diff (completeness violation)

The producer outputs a flat value. The consumer diffs against a cached previous value to discover what changed.

**Where it appears:** Boundary 1 — a text diff discovers the damage region after a CRDT operation.

**Cost:** O(n) on text length per edit instead of O(1) from the operation.

**Fix:** Have the producer carry the change information directly. The CRDT operation already knows what position was affected — surface that information in the intermediate output instead of discarding it and rediscovering it.

### The Position Fixup (context-freedom violation)

The structure stores absolute positions. Moving or reusing a subtree requires recursively updating all positions within it.

**Where it would appear:** If CST nodes stored absolute `(start, end)` spans instead of relative widths.

**Cost:** O(subtree size) per reuse instead of O(1). Makes incremental parsing infeasible for large files.

**Prevention:** Store only intrinsic properties (kind, relative width, children). Compute absolute context lazily in a wrapper layer that accumulates widths on traversal.

### The Type Split (uniform error violation)

Success and failure produce different types, forcing every consumer to handle two separate code paths.

**Example:** A parse function that returns either a complete AST or an error, with no way to obtain partial structure on failure.

**Cost:** Error-tolerant operations (display partial AST, offer completions at error site) become impossible. Every consumer must handle the error branch even when it could work with partial structure.

**Prevention:** Make error a variant of the output type, not a separate channel. The construction always produces the output type; errors are values within the structure. A strict/raising wrapper for convenience is acceptable as long as the recovery path also exists.

### The Construction Protocol (transparency violation)

The structure requires methods to be called in a specific order, or has invariants that are not enforced by the type system.

**Example:** "You must call `finalize()` after building the tree" or "children must be sorted by kind" documented in a comment.

**Cost:** Every new consumer must understand how the structure was built in order to use it correctly. The producer's construction logic leaks into the consumer.

**Prevention:** Make the structure self-describing. If an invariant matters, enforce it in the type (sorted collection type, builder pattern that returns the final type only on completion). If a consumer can misuse the structure by reading its public fields naively, the structure is not transparent.

## 4. Design Decision Guide

When designing a new boundary or evaluating a proposed intermediate representation:

**Step 1 — Identify producer and consumer.**
What constructs the structure? What folds or interprets it? Are there multiple consumers?

**Step 2 — Test completeness.**
Can every consumer be written using only this structure? If a consumer needs to access the original input or a sibling boundary's output, the structure is missing information. Add it.

**Step 3 — Assess reuse requirements.**
Will this structure be incrementally reused (updated when input changes partially)? If yes, fragments must be context-free — no absolute positions, no parent pointers, no global indices. If the boundary is batch (one-shot), context-freedom is a guideline, not a requirement.

**Step 4 — Design the failure mode.**
What happens when input is malformed? If the answer is "return an error and no structure," redesign. The construction should always produce the output type, with errors represented as values within the structure. This ensures downstream consumers always receive something to work with.

**Step 5 — Verify transparency.**
Can a new consumer be written by reading the type definition alone? If the consumer needs to understand construction order, call methods in sequence, or respect undocumented invariants, the structure is opaque.

### Complexity Calibration

Not every boundary needs the same investment. Match the solution to the complexity:

| Complexity | Characteristics | Appropriate solution |
|---|---|---|
| Lowest | No polymorphism, no failure | Simple function |
| Low | Fixed schema, no recursion | Dedicated parser |
| Medium | One axis of polymorphism | Intermediate value + projection |
| High | Recursion + failure | Parser combinators with error recovery |
| Highest | Both axes + incremental reuse | Full four-property compliance, dependency tracking |
