# Documentation Index

Documentation for **Canopy** — an incremental projectional editor with CRDT
collaboration, built in MoonBit.

If this is your first time here, read the pages in order: **Start Here →
Learning Path → API / Reference**. Contributor, deep-design, and historical
material is grouped at the bottom and is not required reading.

---

## Start Here

- **[Project README](../README.md)** — what Canopy is, what it looks like, and
  the Quick Start (clone, `moon test`, run the web demo).
- **[Live demo](https://canopy-ideal.pages.dev)** — try the editor in your
  browser before diving into internals.
- **[日本語版紹介 (Japanese introduction)](japanese-introduction.md)** —
  product overview in Japanese.

## Learning Path

Read in order to build a mental model of the system.

1. **[Product Vision](architecture/product-vision.md)** — what Canopy is trying
   to be: write, auto-structure, surface.
2. **[The Projectional Bridge](architecture/vision-projectional-bridge.md)** —
   why: syntax → semantics → intent → mental model.
3. **[Architecture Overview](architecture.md)** — single-page summary of the
   pipeline, package responsibilities, key invariants, and extension points.
4. **[System Architecture Diagram](architecture/ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md)** —
   high-level data flow: Text CRDT → Incremental Parse → Projection → Rendering.
5. **[Module Structure](architecture/modules.md)** — how the monorepo and
   submodules map onto that pipeline.
6. **[Responsibility Map](architecture/responsibility-map.md)** — ownership
   boundaries, reuse-first APIs, and the current extension priority order.
7. **[Incremental Hylomorphism](architecture/Incremental-Hylomorphism.md)** —
   the compositional engine underneath.
8. **[Multi-Representation System](architecture/multi-representation-system.md)**
   — the `Printable` trait family (Show, Debug, Source, Pretty).

> The earlier "Projectional Editing" deep-dive has been archived to
> [`archive/PROJECTIONAL_EDITING.md`](archive/PROJECTIONAL_EDITING.md). It is
> retained for historical context only and is known to disagree with the
> current code in several places. Use the architecture overview above
> instead.

Further architecture notes live in [docs/architecture/](architecture/).

## API / Reference

For users calling Canopy from MoonBit or JavaScript.

- **[API Reference](development/API_REFERENCE.md)** — high-level MoonBit API
  overview (`SyncEditor`, `ProjNode`, etc.).
- **[JS Integration Guide](development/JS_INTEGRATION.md)** — using the editor
  from JavaScript / the web.
- **[Tree Editing Manual](development/TREE_EDIT_MANUAL.md)** — structural
  projectional editing reference.
- **[Adding a Language](development/ADDING_A_LANGUAGE.md)** — integrate a new
  language into the framework (uses Markdown as the reference implementation).
- **[Audio DSL Reactive Foundation](development/audio-dsl-reactive-foundation.md)**
  — requirements and benchmark baselines for a Canopy-hosted audio DSL that
  lowers into MoonDsp through `incr`.

Per-module READMEs:

- [event-graph-walker](../event-graph-walker/README.md) — CRDT engine.
- [loom](../loom/README.md) — incremental parser framework.

- [Performance Results](performance/PERFORMANCE_RESULTS.md)

**Infrastructure:**

- [CI/CD](CI_CD.md)

## Deep Design (Grand Design)

Long-range design explorations. Treat as **direction, not implemented
behavior** — check the code before relying on any specific detail.

- **[Grand Design](design/GRAND_DESIGN.md)** — vision, principles, and
  implementation order.
  - [01 — Edit Bridge](design/01-edit-bridge.md)
  - [02 — Reactive Pipeline](design/02-reactive-pipeline.md)
  - [03 — Unified Editor](design/03-unified-editor.md)
  - [04 — Ephemeral Store](design/04-ephemeral-store.md)
  - [05 — Tree Edit Roundtrip](design/05-tree-edit-roundtrip.md)
- [Design Concerns](design/design-concerns.md) — open problems and future
  considerations.
- [Decisions Needed](decisions-needed.md) — open architectural questions.

**Architectural Decision Records (ADRs):**

- [Framework Genericity Contract](decisions/2026-03-29-framework-genericity-contract.md)
  — why `framework/` and `core/` must stay language-agnostic.

`AGENTS.md` at the repo root is the canonical agent guidance file. `CLAUDE.md`
is a compatibility symlink and should not be edited directly.
