# Documentation Index

Documentation for the Lambda Calculus CRDT Editor project.

## Quick Start

- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Quick reference for Claude Code
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview

## Grand Design

The long-range vision for combining eg-walker CRDT + loom incremental parser
into a collaborative projectional editor. Some parts of this stack are already
implemented in the root MoonBit packages and the `examples/rabbita` app; these
design docs describe the remaining target architecture and intended cleanup.

- **[Grand Design](design/GRAND_DESIGN.md)** — Vision, principles, and implementation order
  - [01 — Edit Bridge](design/01-edit-bridge.md) — CRDT ops → loom `Edit` without string diffing
  - [02 — Reactive Pipeline](design/02-reactive-pipeline.md) — Replace manual dirty-flags with `Signal`/`Memo`
  - [03 — Unified Editor](design/03-unified-editor.md) — Single `SyncEditor` facade
  - [04 — Ephemeral Store](design/04-ephemeral-store.md) — Peer cursors and presence
  - [05 — Tree Edit Roundtrip](design/05-tree-edit-roundtrip.md) — Structural AST edits via text CRDT
  - [Design Concerns](design/design-concerns.md) — Future considerations and open problems
